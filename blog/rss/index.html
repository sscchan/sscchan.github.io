The current flood comes on the heels of an earlier flood just one and a half months ago in mid September.</p><p>As part of the design and maintenance of a sensible urban planning policy, a proper understanding of the area's flood risks is required. Comprehensive flood studies are used to quantitatively analyze and evaluate the risks, hazards and potential human &amp; economic losses associated with potential flood events.</p><p>Often, flood studies are lacking in developing parts of the world due to data, expertise and resource constraints. The current tragic flood event has prompted me to search for any data that may help inform the general public of the city's flood risk.</p><h4 id="flood-risk-data">Flood Risk Data</h4><p>I had managed to dig out an old 1991 drainage and flooding study of Penang produced by JICA. This study had produced a flood map for 5, 10, 30, 50 &amp; 100 year ARI events. Unfortunately, the poorly scanned map is not very accessible for the general public due to missing roads and features from the scanning process as well as unnecessary clutter from the map's design:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://sscchan.github.io/blog/content/images/2017/11/p-_floodmap_small.png" class="kg-image" alt="Digitized Penang JICA Drainage Study Floodmap"></figure><h4 id="georeferencing-data-transformation">Georeferencing &amp; Data Transformation</h4><p>In order to improve the accessibility of this floodmap and assist with informing the general public. I had georeferenced the scanned image in GIS and digitized the 5, 10, 50 and 100 year ARI flood extent boundaries.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://sscchan.github.io/blog/content/images/2017/11/a_floodmap_overlaid_scaled.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Digitized Penang JICA Drainage Study Floodmap"></figure><h4 id="digitized-data-on-online-map-ui">Digitized Data on Online Map UI</h4><p>The digitized data presented in a modern map UI below should help inform the public about the flood risks in Penang.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div id="iframe-container" style="

It is therefore prudent to treat any flood map only as a rough guide.</p><p>Finally, I am <em>not</em> the author of the JICA paper. My effort only included the digitization of the flood map results and making it accessible via the internet. Please read the original report to gain an understanding of the modeling process and parameters.</p><p>Finally, there are no guarantee on the quality and suitability of the digitized map itself.

Markov Chains are described "memoryless", where the probability of the future state is entirely and only dependent on the current state and not the previous states.</p><h4 id="how-are-tweets-and-markov-chain-related">How are Tweets and Markov Chain related?</h4><p>Are the words contained within a tweet generated via a stochastic process that satisfies the Markov property? <strong><strong><em>absolutely not</em></strong></strong></p><p>So why do you want to model tweets as a Markov Chain? <strong><strong>because it's</strong></strong> <strong><strong><em>hilarious</em></strong></strong></p><h4 id="getting-the-tweet-data">Getting the Tweet Data</h4><p>Twitter provides an API for reading and writing tweet data. It's also useless for our purpose because Twitter only returns tweets from the last three weeks. Very sad.</p><p>But it looks like <a href="http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/">trumptwitterarchive.com</a> have a database of historical tweets from the president-elect. So I've copied all of the tweets from 2016 to a local text file.</p><h4 id="tweet-data-preprocessing">Tweet Data Preprocessing</h4><p>We'll need to pre-process our data so we can produce a sensible looking transition matrix. String elements such as links to articles, quotes and urls are removed using Regex.</p><h4 id="modelling-tweets-as-a-markov-chain">Modelling Tweets as a Markov Chain</h4><p>Strictly speaking, we are modelling the <strong><strong>process</strong></strong> of writing out a tweet as a Markov Chain. Each word of the tweet is represented by a system state. With the knowledge of the present system state (current word) we can obtain the future system state (next word) using the transition matrix.</p><h5 id="a-tweet-s-first-word-">A Tweet's First Word:</h5><p>We will need to set an initial condition for our system before the Markov process of writing out the subsequent word can begin. From our dataset, we can determine the probability distribution of the first word (initial condition) of the tweet:</p><pre><code>function calculateFirstWordsProbabilities(tweets)
{
  let tweetFirstWords = [];
  tweets.forEach(extractFirstWordofTweet);
  tweetFirstWordsProbability = convertToProbabilityArray(tweetFirstWords);

  function extractFirstWordofTweet(tweet) {
    let words = tweet.split(' ');
    tweetFirstWords.push(words[0]);
  }  
}
</code></pre><p>If your dataset is small, you can conceivably just populate an array of all of the first words of each tweet (with repeats). That will simplify the process as we no longer need to calculate the cumulative distribution function. This will probably require <strong><strong><em>lots</em></strong></strong> of storage for any decent size dataset.</p><h5 id="determining-the-transition-matrix">Determining the Transition Matrix</h5><p>Given that the state space is very large (all unique words within our tweets dataset). I've chosen to implement the transition matrix as an hash table with the <code>key</code> representing the current state and the <code>value</code> as an <code>array</code> of future states and their associated probabilities. This minimises storage requirement as the transition matrix is very sparse.</p><pre><code>function populateMarkovFrequencies(tweet) {
  let words = tweet.split(' ');

  for (let i = 0; i &lt; words.length; i++) {
    let word = words[i];
    let isLastWordinTweet = (i === (words.length - 1));

    if (markovTransition[word] === undefined) {
      markovTransition[word] = [];
    }

    if (isLastWordinTweet) {
      markovTransition[word].push('\n');
    } else {
      let nextWordInTweet = words[i+1];
      markovTransition[word].push(nextWordInTweet); 
    }
  }

function processMarkovTransition() {
  for (let word in markovTransition) {
    markovTransition[word] = convertToProbabilityArray(markovTransition[word]);
  }
}
</code></pre><h5 id="done-">Done!</h5><p>All we need to do now is to use the transition matrix to generate our own tweet!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Optimizing Water Supply Networks with Genetic Algorithm (Part II)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>This Part II of my blogpost on the application that helps with optimizing water supply networks using genetic algorithm. </p><hr><p>The application is written in C/C++.<br>Project Code on: <a href="https://github.com/sscchan/Genetic-Algorithm-Optimization-of-Water-Supply-System">GitHub</a></p><h4 id="genetic-algorithm">Genetic Algorithm</h4><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">Genetic algorithm</a> is a method for optimization process that is inspired by natural selection.
